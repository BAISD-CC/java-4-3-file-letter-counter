Our boss wants to be able to access astronaut names from individual files now. We told him that this was not going to help get us to space, but he insists that he needs the stars to align in our favor. Typical Scorpio. Anyway, listen, you don't need to worry about creating those files or anything for right now. He already has them, but he wants to be able to open them using your software. Opening files will come in handy later.

Please write a program that asks the user to enter the name of a file, and then asks the user to enter a character. The program should count and display the number of times that the letter appears in the file (just like last time). The files are already provided and are named "Astronaut'[x]'.txt."

You can recycle a lot of code from the last assignment. This type of change to add functionality to an old piece of software is referred to as "iterative design", and it is how most engineering, including software and aerospace works. Everyone is iterating everything all the time. Don't feel bad if your code is basic at first. Windows was written one line at a time.


Things you need to pass the tests:
Input 1 - "Please enter the name of the file."
Input 2 - "Enter a letter that you want counted."
Output 1 - "The letter `[letter]` appears `[number]` times in that file."
